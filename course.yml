description      : Are all Yelp restaurant reviews are created equal? Or should one place greater trust in reviews by someone who knows a cuisine well (e.g. reviews of an ethnic restaurant by people of that ethnicity)? <p> Welcome to our tutorial on Yelp Review Modifications, based on a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.springboard.com/blog/eat-rate-love-an-exploration-of-r-yelp-and-the-search-for-good-indian-food">Springboard blog post</a> by Robert Chen about his final project in Springboard's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.springboard.com/workshops/data-science">Foundations of Data Science</a> workshop, with the help of his mentor Andi Bandyopadhyay. Here you will learn the techniques that Robert used to tailor the Yelp star reviews for restaurants.</p> <p>Exercises on importing data, data manipulation and data visualization will teach you how to “cut through the noise” and deliver useful metrics for finding a great place to eat on Friday night! The course is an interesting take on a dilemma that we all face on a regular basis. Is the information that is available to us useful? In many cases, yes, but too often a cloud shrouds the real value that the information has. The best part of this course is getting to explore a real world problem and learning how to remove the haze for yourself!<p/>
