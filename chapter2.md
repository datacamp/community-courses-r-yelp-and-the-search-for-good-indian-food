## Exploring the data

The second chapter of this tutorial will be an alternative method of manipulating the Yelp star reviews. You will be working with the same sample of reviews of Indian restaurants but adapting the star reviews in a different way. 

This method looks to adapt the star reviews with the perception that Yelp reviewers with Indian heritage would provide more accurate and authentic reviews for Indian cuisine. The strategy for manipulating the star reviews involves selecting only the reviewers with Indian names for the aggregate restaurant star review. 

This means that you need a way to select just the users with native Indian names and that is where this chapter begins! 

You will first load in a list of native Indians names that can be used to sort users. A list of native Indian names is located on our server in a text file `indian_names.txt`. The object `indian_names_url` contains a link to the data. Use the `indian_names_url` and the `scan` function to create a list `indian_names` that contains the native names you will use to sort the users.


*** =instructions
- Use `scan()` to load in the `indian_names.txt` file
- Display the first 10 names with `head()`

*** =hint
When loading the names don't change the sample_code! Just remove the `#`

```

*** =sample_code
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# This url contains the .txt file with Indian names. (Note: Don't change this code)
indian_names_url <-url("http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1073/datasets/indian_names.txt")

# Read Indian names into a list
#indian_names <- scan(indian_names_url, what = character())

# Show the first 10 names from the indian_names list
head(indian_names, ___)

```

# This url contains the .txt file with Indian names. (Note: Don't change this code)
indian_names_url <-url("http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1073/datasets/indian_names.txt")

# Read Indian names into a list
indian_names <- scan(indian_names_url, what = character())

# Show the first 10 names from the indian_names list

```

## Cleaning the names list
 
Now that you have a list of native Indian names, make sure that the list will do what you need it to. The list was taken from an online resource and may contain names that don't make sense or aren't useful. 

Take a look at the list and see if any names don't fit. The `unlist()` displays the names well. 

Looks like there are a few names that could select users that would be hard to tell whether they were native Indian or not. 

The single character names like `A.`, `C.` or `K.` may select users that we don't want. You should remove those names from the list before using it to select the native Indian users.

You can do this by finding a regular expression that will find all the names with a single character followed by a `.`. The regular expression `[A-z]\\.` should do the trick. Combine the regular expression with the `grep` function to locate the names that you want to eliminate. These locations can be used to eliminate just the names you don't want.


*** =instructions
- Display the names list with `unlist()`
- Use `grep` and the regular expression `[A-z]\\.` to locate the names you want to eliminate
- Double check that those are the right names
- Remove the unwanted names from the `indain_names` list using `-indian_names_remove`
- Display the cleaned names list with `unlist()`

*** =hint
When there is a `#` before the sample_code, don't change it, just remove the `#`

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r,eval=FALSE}
indian_names_url <-url("http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1073/datasets/indian_names.txt")

# Read Indian names into a list
indian_names <- scan(indian_names_url, what = character())
```

*** =sample_code
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Show the names list
#unlist(indian_names)

# Locate the names that you want to eliminate
indian_names_remove <- grep("___",indian_names, perl = TRUE)

# Check to make sure they are the correct names
#indian_names[indian_names_remove]

# Eliminate them from the indian_names list
indian_names_clean <- indian_names[-____]

# Display a table of the cleaned names list
#unlist(indian_names_clean)


```

*** =solution
```{r,eval=FALSE}
# Show the names list
unlist(indian_names)

# Locate the names that you want to eliminate
indian_names_remove <- grep("[A-z]\\.",indian_names, perl = TRUE)

# Check to make sure they are the correct names
indian_names[indian_names_remove]

# Eliminate them from the indian_names list
indian_names_clean <- indian_names[-indian_names_remove]

# Display a table of the cleaned names list
unlist(indian_names_clean)


```

## Finding authentic users
 
You have successfully cleaned the list of native Indian names and you are ready to select just the reviews from the users that have a name that is part of this list. 

The `subset` function will make this task simple. Split the `indian` data set by defining the `subset` argument within the `subset` function. You can define the column to in which to divide the data by with the `subset` argument. Using the `%in%` operator, you can define criteria in which to select from the column defined by the `subset` function. In this case, it would be looking for authentic Indian names within the `user_name` column.

Example Subset Code:
<p>`alpha = c("A","B","C","D","E","F")`
<p>`subset(alpha, alpha %in% "A")`
<p>`[1] "A"`</p>

After successfully subsetting the data, generate a table of the authentic Indian users to get a sense of the size of the data.

Take a look at the number of users in each city. The `select`, `group_by`, `summarise` and `n()` functions of the `dplyr` package are great tools for quickly calculating the users in each city.  
 
*** =instructions
- Subset the `indian` data set to just the users with native Indian names. Use the operator `%in%` with the `indian_names_clean` data set as the subset terms.
- Generate a table of the `authentic_users`.
- Generate the `number_authentic_city` data frame using `select`, `group_by`, `summarise` and `n()`.
- Display the total number of authentic users in each city.

## How many authentic users?

Now that you have selected just the users with native Indian names you are ready to begin manipulating the reviews. Before you do,however, take a moment to explore the new data set and answer the following question.

Take a look at the `authentic_uers` and `number_authentic_city` data sets with `str()` or `summary()` and then calculate the total number of authentic users.

*** =instructions
- 67
- 91
- 56
- 121
  
*** =hint
- a simple sum of the `number_authentic_city$users` would tell you the total users

## Generating average authenic reviews

You've now selected your authentic Indian users and can use their reviews to generate average authentic star reviews! 

There are many ways to do this but the `dplyr` package, as you have seen, has many great tools to quickly group data, add new columns and calculate new values. You will use the `select`, `group_by`, `summarise` and `mutate` functions to add new variables to the larger data set. 

The `select` function allows you to isolate the variables you wish to use to create the new values. The `group_by()`, `%>%` and `summarized()` functions allow for separate calculations to be performed within the unique values of the variable  or variables being grouped. 

You should create a new star review column called `new_star` and a column of the difference between the original average star reviews and the new star reviews. Assign the column of differences to `diff`. 

*** =instructions
- Generate a data frame `avg_review_indian` using tools from `dplyr`
<p>- `group_by` the variables `city`, `business_name`, and `avg_stars`</p><p>- Use the `n()` function to tally the number of reviews for that restaurant</p><p>- Create a `new_stars` column using a `sum` of the `stars` column</p><p>- Using the `mutate` function, add a `diff` variable by subtracting the `new_stars` column by the `avg_stars` column
*** =hint
- Don't remove any of the `%>%` operators and make sure you have one after each function. Also the order of `group_by()` can change the results! Check the instructions for the correct order.

## Detecting manipulation effect 

Now that you have created new average star reviews based on the authentic Indian users, let's see if you can detect the effects of the modifications. 

To do so you will make use of the `hist` plot and the `geom_bar()` plot from the `ggplot2` package. These graphs will help you visualize the effect of your modification. Take note of the magnitudes of the changes and if there were any patterns in the distribution of the difference in star reviews.

The graphs will be rendered from the `avg_review_indian` data frame containing the `new_stars` and the `avg_stars` reviews.

*** =instructions
- Create a histogram of the `avg_stars` using the `hist()` function
- Create a histogram of the `new_stars` using the `hist()` function
- Plot the distribution of changes to star reviews using the `hist()` function 
- Plot the changes to per restaurant using `ggplot()` and `geom_bar()`.

Remember to remove the `#` from the code to run! Don't change the `ggplot()` sample code.
